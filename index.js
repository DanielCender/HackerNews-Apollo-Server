/**
 *	## Y Combinator Hacker News (HN) GraphQL API Mockup ##
 *
 * API on GitHub: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories
 *
 *
 * Access Patterns for this API:
 *
 * getStory: id -> Story: { Comments: [] }
 * getTopStories: () -> [Story: { Comments: [] }]
 * getUser: (username) -> User: { Stories: [] }
 *
 * Ref link: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories
 * Since this will be a PWA, I would like to cache the most recent/top stories, or even a list of whichever ones
 * the user clicks a button indicator on, to know which they'd like to keep offline.
 *
 * So maybe, just need one or two queries to access this, like:
 * 	type Query {
 * 		listTopStories(): [Story]
 * 		listDescendants(id: ID): [Comment] # Story and Comments have desc., but all desc are Comments by nature
 *    getUserById(id: ID!): User
 * }
 *
 * Those stories would have nested comments beneath them, which in turn may have nested descendants to one or two levels
 * of depth themselves.
 *
 * 	listTopStories {
 * 		...Listable, # interface Story extends
 * 		url
 * }
 *
 * 	## Apollo Graph Manager ##
 *
 * 	Useful for analytics, error reporting, and versioning: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/production/#what-are-the-benefits-of-graph-manager
 *
 * 	To publish API to Graph Manager, first put ENGINE_API_KEY in .env file, then:
 * 	Run: `npx apollo service:push --endpoint=http://localhost:4000`
 * 	while this server is running (i.e. run `node index.js` in root).
 *
